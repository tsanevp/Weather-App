## My process

### Built with
#### FrontEnd
- HTML5
- CSS
- JS
#### Backend
- Node.js

#### Deployed On
- Fly.io

### What I learned

- Working with transitions in CSS and replacing text using JS
- How to communicate and send data between my front & back-end code

### Continued development

- [ ]  Improve UX and front-end design of the city search page
- [ ]  Add detailed About page rather than redirecting back to GitHub

### Useful resources
