## Overview

### The challenge

- Creating my first Express.js/Node.js project:
    - It was a great learning opportunity to challenge myself in making a basic calculator using Express.js & Node.js. To better understand how to work in Express, all the calculation logic was handled on the back-end.
- Working with GET/POST requests
- Keeping my code readable and easy to understand

## My process

### Built with
#### FrontEnd
- HTML5
- CSS
- JS
#### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js

### What I learned

- How to use Express.js to host a server locally
- How to communicate and send data between my front & back-end code

### Continued development

- [ ]  Improve UX and front-end design of the city search page
- [ ]  Add additional buttons and features to the calculator

### Useful resources

- [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) - Was constantly referring to documentation
